# Awesome Image Tools [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of tools for compressing, converting, resizing, editing and inspecting images.

There are hundreds of image utilities and most "best image tool" lists are just affiliate roundups. This one is opinionated. It leans toward tools that **run in your browser without uploading your files**, tools that are **open source**, and the handful of hosted services that are genuinely worth the trade-off. Freemium tools are marked so you know before you click.

The list is intentionally small enough to maintain by hand. If a tool stops being free, changes its privacy model, or no longer deserves its spot, open an issue.

**Legend**

- 🔒 — Runs entirely in your browser. Files are never uploaded to a server.
- `OSS` — Open source. Source link in the entry.
- `$` — Has a paid tier. A usable free tier exists unless noted.
